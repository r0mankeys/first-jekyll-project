This is my first new page that is not intended to be a blog post, just a plain old page, heres how I did that:

Very very straightforward, no steps required, I simply made the markdown file in my root project directory, that where all pages are kept. Unlike posts the files do not be made using the standard date format, they simply follow the syntax `<file-name>.md`.
